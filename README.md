## 📘 Project Overview

Hues.AI transforms natural-language descriptions into architectural floorplans.  
Powered by Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) with LoRA fine-tuning, my model learns structural patterns such as:  

- 🛋️ Room distribution  
- 🚪 Spatial flow  
- 📐 Interior layout conventions  
- 🏛️ Consistent architectural geometry  

The project offers:  

✅ A refined model trained on **my curated dataset**  
✅ A Flask-based API for programmatic generation  
✅ A Hugging Face Space demo  
✅ Google Colab GPU deployment  
✅ Clear dataset and training pipeline documentation  

---

## ⭐ Key Features

- 📝 Generate architectural floorplans from pure text  
- 🧩 LoRA-enhanced SDXL for domain-specific accuracy  
- 🌐 Public Hugging Face Space deployment  
- 🔌 Flask inference API (local + Colab)  
- 📦 Clean dataset for reproducible training  
- 🖼️ Supports high-resolution 1024×1024 output

## 🌐 Live Demo

Experience Hues.AI instantly through my hosted demo:  

🔗 [https://mai2026-sdxl-lora-floorplan.hf.space](https://mai2026-sdxl-lora-floorplan.hf.space)  

This Hugging Face Space runs my fine-tuned model and allows me (or anyone) to generate floorplans without installing anything. 🚀💻

---

## 🧩 Model Artifacts (`model/` folder)

My `model/` folder currently contains:  

1️⃣ `pytorch_lora_weights.safetensors`  
- My fine-tuned LoRA weights — this file injects architectural knowledge into SDXL.  

2️⃣ `config.json`
```json
{
  "base_model_name_or_path": "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0"
}
```
---

This indicates:  
⚡ The LoRA is built on top of SDXL Base 1.0  
⚡ No additional LoRA-specific metadata exists  
⚡ Loading is straightforward and compatible with the Diffusers pipeline

## 🚀 Running the Project

### Option 1 — Local Execution (with `python app.py`)

1️⃣ **Install dependencies** 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2️⃣ **Place the LoRA weights**  
Ensure the file is located at:  

```bash
model/pytorch_lora_weights.safetensors
``` 

3️⃣ **Update the path in app.py**  

```bash
lora_path = "model/pytorch_lora_weights.safetensors"  
```

4️⃣ **Run the server**  

```bash
python app.py  
```

**Local server: http://localhost:5000**🌐

### Option 2 — Google Colab GPU Deployment (Primary Method)

1️⃣ **Open my notebook**
2️⃣ **Install requirements**
3️⃣ **Load SDXL + LoRA**
4️⃣ **Start Flask:**
```python
app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```
5️⃣ **Expose via ngrok:**
```python
from pyngrok import ngrok
ngrok.connect(5000)
```
** Use the ngrok URL for inference. 🚀🔗**
